# InstaSalleProject
Data structures project, where we compare different structures in different scenarios.

The purpose of the program is that, from the different data structures, we implement them along with their modes of insertion, elimination and search.
Then the program will allow us to import data from two JSON files (users and posts) to the different data structures.
Once imported, we will be able to add / delete information, visualize the structure's status and make different types of searches.
The program also offers the possibility to export the current status of the structure as json files, then import them, and continue from the saved state of the structure.


For a more detailed explanation, read the InstaSalleProject PDF, where there are the comparative graphs and conclusions of the project.
